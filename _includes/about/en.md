Hey, I'm Yang Yang, an ordinary computer science student. I graduated from [Nanjing Waste University](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8D%97%E4%BA%AC%E9%82%AE%E7%94%B5%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/1004526) with a degree in Computer Science and Technology, and now I'm going to USTC for the second time. Although NJUPT is really quite ordinary, he did let me switch from a garbage human resource management major to a computing major, which in my opinion now also feels like a very lucky thing. After that, I was very lucky to be admitted to USTC, and I felt that everything that happened was something that I could not imagine before I changed my major. In my free time befor the start of graduate school, I saw a quote from [Breaking Bad](https://movie.douban.com/subject/2373195/), "Today is the first day of the rest of my life", so I decided to record something. So there was [Yang blog](https://doublesheeps.github.io/).
(This is me now. I'll add more if I get more experience)
